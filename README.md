things that don't deserve their own repo

  __profile.ps1__
  
My standard profile. Includes features such as:

  • p/invoke the win32 console functions to manipulate the host
  
  • define various color schemes such as Solarized (https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
  
    ^ and functions to modify the host to implement those schemes
    
  • a couple of helper functions so I don't have to remember function names
  
  • a Prompt function override that displays helpful information on the command line
  
  • logic to modify the host window name to reflect the execution mode of the host
  
    - 86/64 bit
    
    - admin privileges
    
  • changes background color to DarkRed if executing as admin (this can save your life).
  
  • other junk
